In 1820, Fort Snelling was established at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers.\n4. The Minnesota Territory was created in 1849, which set the stage for eventual statehood.\n5.

Lumber: The vast forests in northern Minnesota made lumber a major industry.\n2. Agriculture: Wheat farming was particularly important, with Minneapolis becoming a major flour milling center.\n3. Iron ore mining: The discovery of iron ore in the Mesabi Range in the 1860s led to significant mining operations.\n4. Fur trading: While declining by the time of statehood, it had been a crucial early industry.\n5. Transportation: The Mississippi River and later railroads were vital for moving goods and people.\n\nThese industries shaped Minnesota's early development and laid the foundation for its future growth.

Location: The Mesabi Range is located in northeast Minnesota and is about 110 miles long and 1-3 miles wide.\n\n3. Economic impact: It became one of the world's largest iron ore mining districts, significantly boosting Minnesota's economy.\n\n4. Steel industry: The high-quality iron ore from the Mesabi Range was crucial for the U.S. steel industry, particularly during World Wars I and II.\n\n5. Technology: The development of open-pit mining and new transportation methods revolutionized the industry.\n\n6. Communities: Mining led to the growth of many towns in northern Minnesota, like Hibbing and Virginia.\n\n7. Environmental impact: While economically beneficial, mining also had significant environmental effects that are still being addressed today.\n\n8.
